# Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This test plan describes the strategy, scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing the **QA Sample Project**.  
The purpose of this document is to ensure the application is tested systematically and that quality standards are met before release.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Validate that all core features work as expected.  
- Identify and document any defects or issues.  
- Ensure the product meets business and user requirements.  
- Provide stakeholders with confidence in the product's stability.  

---

## 3. Scope
### In Scope
- Functional testing of core features.  
- Regression testing for previously validated features.  
- Smoke testing after builds.  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) based on business scenarios.  

### Out of Scope
- Performance/load testing.  
- Security penetration testing.  
- Non-production environments not listed below.  

---

## 4. Test Items
- Web application front-end (UI elements, forms, navigation).  
- Backend integration (database CRUD operations).  
- Authentication and login module.  

---

## 5. Test Approach
- **Manual Testing:** Execute predefined test cases.  
- **Test Case Design:** Based on requirements and user stories.  
- **Defect Tracking:** Issues will be logged in the Bug Report document.  
- **Regression Testing:** Run on every new build.  

---

## 6. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan (this document)  
- Test Cases ([TestCases.md](TestCases.md))  
- Bug Reports ([BugReports.md](BugReports.md))  
- Test Report ([TestReport.md](TestReport.md))  

---

## 7. Test Environment
- OS: Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)  
- Browser: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Edge (latest)  
- Test Data: Dummy data sets created for functional flows  
- Tools: Manual test execution, GitHub Issues for bug tracking  

---

## 8. Entry Criteria
- Requirements are documented and available.  
- Test environment is ready and accessible.  
- Initial build is deployed successfully.  

## 9. Exit Criteria
- All high/critical severity defects are resolved.  
- Test coverage has reached at least 90%.  
- UAT sign-off from stakeholders.  

---

## 10. Risks & Assumptions
- Risk: Incomplete requirements may lead to missed test scenarios.  
- Risk: Limited time may reduce regression coverage.  
- Assumption: Test environment will remain stable during the test cycle.
