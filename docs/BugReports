## Test Cases – No Login Required

These test cases focus on areas of the web application that **do not require login credentials**.  
They demonstrate basic functionality, navigation, and usability for public-facing pages.

## Bug Report: Raspberry Pi Kiosk – Firefox Issues

### Description
While setting up a Raspberry Pi 3B in kiosk mode using **Firefox ESR**, we encountered two issues:

**1. Site Resolution Fails Without `www`**  
- Launching `http://clflux.com` fails with:  Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site.
                                            We can’t connect to the server at clflux.com.

- `ping clflux.com` fails, but `ping www.clflux.com` works.  
- Firefox kiosk script launches but requires manual click to access the site.

**2. Persistent Firefox Profile Issues**  
- Even with a dedicated profile (`kiosk-profile`), Firefox sometimes prompts for first-run setup.  
- Clearing cache causes the profile to reset, re-showing onboarding screens.  
- Permissions and `user.js` settings were verified, but first-run prompts persisted in some cases.

---

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye i386) on a Pi 3B.  
2. Install Firefox ESR, `xdotool`, `Openbox`, `xbindkeys`, `unclutter`.  
3. Create a dedicated Firefox profile at `/home/pi/.mozilla/kiosk-profile`.  
4. Launch Firefox in kiosk mode with `http://clflux.com`.  
5. Observe that the site does not load, and first-run prompts may appear.  

---

### Expected Behavior
- Firefox should launch directly to the correct site.  
- Persistent profile should avoid first-run prompts.  
- Hotkeys (Ctrl+Alt+K) should reliably exit kiosk mode.  

---

### Actual Behavior
- `http://clflux.com` fails to resolve; site loads only with `http://www.clflux.com`.  
- Firefox occasionally prompts for first-run setup despite dedicated profile.  
- Cache clearing caused profile to reset.  

---

### Environment
- **Device:** Raspberry Pi 3B  
- **OS:** 2022-07-01-raspios-bullseye-i386.iso  
- **Firefox ESR:** 128.13.0esr (32-bit)  
- **Scripts Used:** `/home/pi/kiosk.sh` (kiosk launcher) and `/home/pi/kiosk-hotkey.sh`  

---

### Workarounds / Notes
- Updating URLs to `http://www.clflux.com` resolves the DNS issue.  
- Using a `user.js` with the following helps with persistent profile behavior:
```javascript
user_pref("browser.onboarding.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone", "ignore");
user_pref("browser.startup.homepage", "http://www.clflux.com");
Ctrl+Alt+K hotkey works reliably via xbindkeys instead of polling with xdotool.
